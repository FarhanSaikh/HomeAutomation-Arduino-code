# HomeAutomation-Arduino-code
This is the code for NODE MCU ESP8266, working fine with firebase database.
The Home Automation is a wireless automation system that is supposed to be implemented in existing home environments, without any changes in the infrastructure. Home automation is the automatic or semi-automatic control and monitoring of household appliances and residential house features like door, gate and even the windows. Home Automation let the user to control the home from his/her computer or mobile phone and assign actions that should happen depending on time or other sensor readings such as light, temperature or sound from any device in the Home Automation network.


Hardwares Required:-

Firebase Real-time Database:
Instead of typical HTTP requests, the Firebase Real-time Database uses data synchronization—every time data changes, any connected device receives that update within milliseconds. Provide collaborative and immersive experiences without thinking about networking code. Data is synced across all clients in real-time and remains available when your app goes offline.
